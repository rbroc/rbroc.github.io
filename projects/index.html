    <h5>At Psychoinformatics Lab, I am contributing to the development of <a href="https://neuroscout.org">Neuroscout</a>, an end-to-end platform for the analysis of naturalistic fMRI data.
I am focusing on expanding Neuroscout&rsquo;s annotation set by implementing feature extraction pipelines that use pretrained deep learning models (e.g., from HuggingFace&rsquo;s transformers and TensorflowHub) in <a href="https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers">pliers</a>.<br>
I am also contributing to validating the platform and its affordances for large-scale neuroimaging research through a series of meta-analytic replications of known neuroimaging findings (preprint forthcoming, code <a href="https://github.com/neuroscout/neuroscout-paper">here</a>), and QA testing its workflows and other components.<br>
For this project, I am working in close connection with Alejandro de la Vega, Research Scientist at UT Austin and PI for the NIH-funded Neuroscout project.</h5>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/rbroc/ctx_transformers/">Bidirectional transformers for context-aware text encoding</a></h4>
    <h5><p>My first engineering project (and the project I am currently most excited about!) focuses on training transformer encoders whose representations incorporate information about higher-order context, i.e., characteristics of the author and/or the pragmatic context. We feed models a target sequence and a number of &lsquo;context&rsquo; sequences (i.e., text from the same author, or from the same subreddit) as a single example, and train models on a variant of MLM where the MLM head is fed the combination ( sum, concatenation, or attention) of token-level representations from the target sequence and an aggregate representation of the contexts.</p>
<p>We experiment with three DistilBERT-inspired architectures: a bi-encoder (where context and target are fed to two separate encoders), a &lsquo;batch&rsquo; encoder (single encoder with added context aggregation and target-context combination layers) and a hierarchical encoder (applying attention across [CLS] tokens in between standard transformer layers to integrate information across contexts and target sequence). The benefits of this training protocol are evaluated both by comparing their MLM performance with no-context MLM training and to random-context training, as well as on a triplet-loss author/subreddit discrimination task. We also experiment with selective masking of attention heads based on the type of context provided to simultaneously produce separable context representations.</p>
<p>The importance of this project is two-fold. First, this way of tuning models to produce context-aware representations may provide intrinsic advantages in NLP tasks (e.g., for MLM, knowledge of the author may make it easier to accurately reconstruct missing words), without substantial increase in model complexity. Secondly, text-based representations of text authors could be used to predict individual traits, following the intuition that linguistic behavior is systematically influenced by personality, experiences, etc.</p>
<p>This project is still in progress, and it has so far been a great source of learning and of motivation to keep working with deep learning and NLP. I had to build a large-scale Reddit dataset from scratch, a &lsquo;big data&rsquo; experience that gained me proficiency in SQL, and I have become increasingly proficient in Tensorflow for both model engineering, distributed training, and efficient data pipelines. Being a self-taught ML engineer, I have made all possible rookie mistakes in the process and have greatly benefitted from each of them.</p>
<p>The project started as a collaboration with Tal Yarkoni, but I have been responsible for implementation throughout and for its evolution in the last months.
Code is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/rbroc/ctx_transformers">in this repository</a>. Planning on making everything nice and tidy once write-up is close, and to share the dataset for public use.</p>

As a part-time postdoc at the <a href="https://interactingminds.au.dk/">Interacting Minds Centre</a> at Aarhus University, I am in charge of mapping drivers of social and political identity across EU countries in a data-driven fashion.<br>
Using the Twitter API (v2), I have created a large multilingual Twitter dataset (EN/DE/IT/DA/PL) containing tweets about the European Union, and I am experimenting with transformers-powered sentiment analysis and topic modeling to understand how and why support to the EU has evolved the last decade.<br>
This project is giving me the opportunity to gain familiarity with existing tools for multilingual text analysis, and to develop awareness of the need for more and better tools for low-resource languages.</h5>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/rbroc/ABM_diversity/">The benefits of cognitive diversity on creative thinking: an agent-based simulation</a></h4>
    <h5>I have a strong interest in social cognition, and especially in how interacting with others shapes the way we think and act. In this project (a collaboration with Kristian Tylén from Aarhus University), we use agent-based simulations to investigate whether and how performing a problem solving task with others makes us come up with better and more creative solutions. We make artificial agents with different word2vec models as semantic memories perform an iterative word association task.<br>
We find that, when performing the association game with a partner, agents tend to produce longer and more creative association chains, and that increasing diversity in their semantic memories promotes more creative behavior. We are currently writing this up as a short conference paper and a more extensive journal submission.<br>
Code (which will soon be tidied up!) is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/rbroc/diversity_abm">here</a>.</h5>

    <h5>In Summer 2021, I worked at the <a href="https://centre.humdata.org/">United Nations&rsquo; Centre for Humanitarian Data</a> as a <a href="https://centre.humdata.org/data-fellows/">Predictive Analytics Data Fellow</a>. During my fellowship, I conducted research on how complex systems modeling (e.g., agent-based simulations, systems dynamics, network models) can be used to understand humanitarian crises, monitor their unfolding and simulate the effectiveness of response plans ahead of implementation.<br>
My research involved methods reviews, interviews with humanitarian actors, <a href="https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa_cholera_sd_pilot">preliminary data analysis</a>, and a final report which introduces complex systems modeling for humanitarians and outlines recommendations on contexts and technical requirements for a pilot.

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/rbroc/benchmarks_paper/">Introducing benchmarks for the evaluation of psychological models</a></h4>
    <h5>Quantitative research in psychology and neighboring field emphasizes explanation and in-sample effect sizes over demonstrating models&rsquo; ability to predict on unseen data (generalization).<br>
In a methods paper that interleaves theoretical arguments with empirical demonstrations (code available in <a href="https://github.com/rbroc/benchmarks_paper">this repo</a>), we show how psychology would benefit from adopting benchmarking as a consensus paradigm for model evaluation.<br>
We discuss how psychology can learn from both the strengths and the known weaknesses (e.g., biases, overfitting) of benchmarking in ML, discuss first steps for introducing these new practices in the field, and outline their potential to increase the practical utility of the outputs of psychological research.<br>

    <h4><a href="/projects/project7/">The neural underpinnings of spatial demonstratives</a></h4>
    <h5>Spatial demonstratives are words like &lsquo;this&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo; used to direct manipulate people&rsquo;s attentional focus. They are extremely frequent, yet far from simple. Understanding what they refer to requires not only knowing language, but also the context in which they are pronounced.<br>
As part of my PhD, I ran a naturalistic fMRI study combining synthesized dialogical narratives, fast multiband acquisition, and finite impulse response modeling to understand how the brain makes sense of them.<br>
I found that spatial words engaged dorsal regions of the brain implicated not only in language, but in various aspects of visuospatial cognition, supporting distributed views of language processing.<br>

    <h4><a href="/projects/project8/">Investigating social modulations of spatial representations through language</a></h4>
    <h5>Humans perceive space as functional to action. Several studies have shown that humans organize space into a peripersonal (i.e., within reach) and an extrapersonal (i.e., outside reach) region.<br>
Interestingly, a lot of the actions we perform in our daily life are performed together with others. Do we adapt the way in which we parse space as near vs. far oto the position of other people when action goals are shared?<br>
We tested this hypothesis over two interactive experiments using language as a proxy for spatial representations.  We found that, in the context of joint action, linguistic coding of locations as proximal vs. distal is based on the position of the partner rather than oneself&rsquo;s.<br>
These studies (part of my PhD) are published in <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em>. The article is available here: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51134-8">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51134-8</a></h5>

    <h4><a href="/projects/project9/">The semantics of spatial demonstratives</a></h4>
    <h5>Spatial demonstratives (words like &lsquo;this&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo;) are thought to map onto a distinction between near and far space. Yet, when people are asked to pair a noun with a demonstrative without any spatial context, choices tend to be non-random. Over a number of large-scale online experiments, I investigated which semantic features of a referent determine which demonstrative people tend to use to refer to it.<br>
Using PCA and multilevel linear modeling, we found that demonstrative choice is systematically influenced by a range of factors including manipulability, valence, and potential for motion. Importantly, the resulting experimental paradigm (the &lsquo;demonstrative choice task&rsquo;) has been used across a number of languages displaying consistent results, and it is currently being used in follow-up studies to investigate whether linguistic behavior in the demonstrative choice task can be used as predictor of personality and clinical traits.<br>
Studies from my PhD using this paradigm have been published in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210333">PlosOne</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00629/full">Frontiers in Psychology</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2021.11">Language and Cognition</a>, and two more are currently in progress.</h5>
